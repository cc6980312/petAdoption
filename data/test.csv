We found her over month ago by the road. She was starving, sick with flu and suffering from mange. After several weeks of treatment she is now healthy, although she has limited vision in her right eye. She is however full of enthusiasm and desperate to meet her forever family and start her new life! I have rescued many cats and kittens over the years and I have to say there is something special about this one. She is extremely loving, yet playful and entertaining at the same time. SHe loves to sit on your lap and look at you. I get the feeling she is genuinely very grateful for getting a second chance in life! Because she has touched our hearts so much, we are looking for an extra special home where she will get special care and attention. Because her sight is affected and she can't always judge distances, we would like her to go to a home where she will be kept as an indoor cat. This is very important. Other than this requirement, she would be happy with adults and children alike, and is happy to approach other cats too. As she will be an indoor cat it would be nice for her to go to a home with another cat so that she has some company whilst her human friends are out and about! It's always good to have two kittens together as they really do enjoy the company of their own species. Kayama has had her first vaccination and has been flea treated and dewormed. She is also litter trained but as with all kittens you will need to be patient as accidents can happen :) In adopting her you agree to make sure she is spayed at 6 months of age to prevent unwanted kittens, and also to keep us updated of her progress. Remember, cats can live around 20 years so in taking on Kayama you must be prepared to look after her for the rest of her life (including being able to pay vet bills as and when necessary). This is a serious commitment and only serious potential owners will be considered. Minimum adoption fee is RM. Any more than this would be greatly appreciated as we have spent over RM getting her well and healthy so any contribution enables us to continue on doing rescue and fostering work.

We weren't sure if she would bite, but luckily she didn't. Carried her out and she was very weak and was also probably in shock. She couldn't even stand. Then a lady came down from the apartments across the road and told us that she had fallen in yesterday. She had put in some bags of leaves and grass (swept by MPAJ) to try and get her to get out, but she just lay on top of the bags and refused to climb out. So the lady fed her yesterday and had come to feed her again today. She was very worried cause no one she knew would help her. Anyway, we have taken her to the vet, and he has discovered that she has recent trauma to her right eye - some internal bleeding. She doesn't seem to have any broken bones but he is worried that there may be some internal damage. So we have taken a blood sample to check and he has given her some meds to support her internal organs while waiting for the results.

She brought the cat home and washed her and fed her but the lady knows she can not keep the cat for long because she is working more than 14 hours per day and nobody is taking care of the cat when she is not home and also she doesn't have a heart to throw out the cat and she thought maybe she can find a nice owner for this beautiful cat. But it was not the end, one week later she found another small kitten in a plastic bag, again in the garbage. She brought the cute little kitten home.

My fosterers say I'm a smart cookie (even though I don't think I'm edible) because I was potty trained at 1 month old! I'm love to play! I might be small now but I am very fiesty! I always get what I want, nobody can resist my puppy eyes! I love my cat mummy (seen in picture), my cat brother, Jamie and my little sister Caramel. I love everything! Can I be your furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we found Maple and her sister, Caramel in a basket in front of the 99 speed mart on a wet rainy night (blame the monsoon season). Poor babies were only 1 week old at most, they still haven't opened their eyes yet. They had to be fed through a bottle because they were so young. But miraculously, one of our foster cats (Miu Miu who we rescued and had a huge tumor on her stomach removed. Miu Miu was nursing our other rescued cat, Jamie also.) was kind and generous enough to nurse them and help take care of them. With Miu miu's help, these babies managed to grow into the bright and spunky puppies they are today! So if you're interested in adopting puppies that were raised by a cat, contact us!

Has marbled fur and beautiful orange eyes. Father was a pure Maine Coon and mother a DLH (see final pics). ‚ô• Surrendered to us with a rather bad fungal issue several months back which he has since fully recovered from. He is now seeking a suitable new family. Character: ‚ô• Ferauni is a frisky boy who adores people to bits - however he will need time to adjust to both a new environment + new cats (as long as they are not aggressive). Constant attention and the presence of humans round the clock makes this process a quick one. ‚ô• When he's not rolling on the sofas purring, acting cute or asking for belly rubs - he LOVES to play. Feather and string toys are his favourite and he has quite some speed and jumping skills to show off. He even ""coo-s"" and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken to. ‚ô• Ferauni loves being cuddled to sleep. He's still learning to stay put while being carried (normally jumps off) but otherwise parks himself super close to us whenever possible. He is very responsive to being called and follows us everywhere around the house. ‚ô• Ferauni is healthy (has completed two vaccine shots + two Revolution spot on treatments, aside from his medical maintenance). He is very clever with the litter-box and not fussy at all about dry or wet food. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ‚óã Ferauni must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments must be cat-safe. ‚óã Neutering is a MUST when he's older. There are far too many homeless kittens out on the streets. ‚óã Ferauni would prefer premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire if unsure, this is for his long term welfare. ‚óã A reimbursement FEE will apply for his partial medical cost + neutering deposit, please inquire. Please drop me a text over on WhatsApp if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this boy home. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated.

Seeing the deplorable condition the puppy is living in (lying around the floor with spilled engine oil, water container contaminated with all sorts of automobile oil and God knows if he's been fed properly), the car owner decided to probe a bit further into how he's been treated all this while. According to some folks around that area, Bear Bear used to have 3 other siblings but Bear Bear is the only one left as the other three were run down by cars which came to the workshop to get their cars fixed. Bear Bear has been brought to the vet for a checkup and blood test. Blood test results show that he's fighting some form of infection and is currently on a course of antibiotics. He has also got cherry eyes (the large red mass bulging out of the inner corner of his eyes. those are actually his own tear glands which popped out) . Anyone who knows about cherry eyes will know that it's a condition which is not visually appealing, but fairly common (especially in certain breeds, Shar Pei is one of them) . However it's actually benign (non life threatening) and can be corrected via surgery. Bear Bear is currently under observation and boarding at the vet's clinic. If all goes well, he would be vaccinated in a couple of days. Since the cherry eye condition is non life threatening, priority is given towards treating his infection. Bear Bear is very friendly towards humans and quiet (not whiny, and exudes a calm personality) We are currently appealing for anyone who can help foster him till he recovers from infection and ready for adoption. Kindly drop us a note at if you could foster Bear Bear whilst we work on getting him rehomed. Please contact Mun Ee for more info =) www.facebook.com/PawsMission",4b4bb2b0a,5,4

I strayed too far from home a few weeks ago and got lost. I eventually found myself at a gas station and meowed for days. By chance, late one night, a human on a routine fill decided to respond to my calls. ‚ô• I appeared happily out of a thicket and ran towards him. He tried to shoo me away (seeing that I looked like someone's pet) but I followed him persistently to his vehicle, making it clear that I wanted to be rescued. ‚ô• Fast forward a couple of weeks, despite several posters and shout-outs, no one has come to claim me. I'm now officially up for adoption. :) ‚ô• Take me not for a weakling! No part of anything I've endured has affected me in any way. I enjoyed my post-rescue car ride and even had a ball interacting with people during my checkup at the vets (I was given a clean bill of health). ‚ô• I'm downright outgoing, adaptable and sociable (that's not just around humans but cats and dogs too)! I love to play (strings and feather toys are my favorites) and when not playing, I enjoy a good cuddling with foster-mummy. WARNING: I have a deep meowing voice and purrs that will melt you to pulp! :) ‚ô• I'm careful with my weapons a.k.a claws and that makes me a great potential companion for kids too. ‚ô• I'm not fussy about food either (will eat kibbles or wet food). I have been vaccinated (first shot), dewormed, de-flead (with Revolution spot-on) and will soon be neutered. *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ‚óò Maxwell would like to be kept INDOORS full-time (if apartments, must be cat safe). ‚óò Maxwell would appreciate some form of premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

When we brought her to the vet, she was diagnosed with having demodex due to her low immunity. After about 9 weeks of treatment, her furs grew and she has became more active. She loves running and playing with other dogs though at times she's a little over-friendly and hyper. A week ago, the fur on her paws started to shed and demodex attack is back. We spoke to the vet about it and vet says that it's most probably her immunity that is causing the growth of the demodex. She has been with the fosterer for 3 months but the fosterer has to move out from her current place and shift to another place where the new landlord doesn't allow any pets. Currently she is in the clinic under the care of vet but the boarding fee is an issue to us. We are looking for experienced adopter (preferably owned a Husky before) where: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging 2. Must be able to provide medical needs, yearly vaccination etc 3. Allow visits & follow ups (send me pictures & videos of Brandy during initial stage of adoption) 4.

It all started at 25th December . A beagle was found resting under a tree near my garage.He was thirsty and hungry.Realizing it was a pure breed Beagle that could probably be someone else's pet,I temporarily adopted the beagle.However,my own dogs didn't seemed to welcomed him as much as we do by barking at beagle most of the time.So,our neighbour adopted the beagle as they seemed to like the beagle so much.Unfortunately,this wasn't the truth.The neighbour had been very irresponsible by letting the beagle to wander around the streets even on heavy rainy days.Desperated,I asked for explaination and requested that the beagle deserves a better owner.The neighbour didn't seemed to feel sorry about their actions and blamed it on the poor beagle.It had only been a week since they adopted the beagle and we can see significant loss of weight in the beagle.However,they gave an excuse that someone in their family will soon be home to take care the beagle.we decided to give them one last chance to repay what they had done but Unfortunately it turns out to be just another wrong decision.This time,the excuse is that the family member which is responsible for taking care of the beagle is leaving Malaysia soon and...=.= Never ending... BUT... they finally gave in when i requested to get the beagle a Good owner again today-4th january . So right now i'm searching for a good, responsible, loving, and patient owner for this beagle. Having a pet is like caring a baby,Not just another plush toy! So,feel free to contact me if you are ready to give your best and you will certainly be surprised by what you would get from this little beagle!! ^0^ Sincerely, Silver Star",470e49e41,5,3

Still, she came to visit me for socialization several hours a day (each time bringing with her yummy bowl of tuna). It wasn't long before I decided she couldn't possibly be of any threat! Foster mummy promised that she would would make me adoptable soon, so that I could go home to a great family. ‚ô• Three weeks into my rehabilitation, and I'm as confident and playful as any other kitten! :) I like rolling over and getting tickled around my tummy/rubbed to a purr-filled snooze. Mind you I can be an extreme cuddle-bug! I LOVE chasing string toys and anything bushy/crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, you name it)! ‚ô• I ADORE being around other cats too (don't care if they hiss or paw at me, I'm ready pester/follow them until my presence is accepted). The more around, the merrier! I must say I love my foster home, but it gets a little tiring having to share everything with the adult felines here! Foster mummy believes I deserve better too.

This poor fellow was mearly 3 weeks old and looked very sickly.I took him to PAWS so that he could be adopted. Despite having to pay RM50/- he will be put to sleep. I changed my mind n took him home. Only recently do I kn how to put pets for adoption in the net. The first meal that I gave him was simply a meal he had not had for days. He ate... n ate... n ate .... till his stomach looks like a barrel. He is with me since then and now he is one year old n three weeks (I suppose). He started to be aggressive as he matured. Even after spaying him for a month now he is aggressive. He would attack other adult male cats when threatened. If I managed to separate them he would turn his attack towards other female cats nearby n if I pull him away his eyes would focus on my arm n hand and will want to bite me. (He has bitten me before).Well this morning again it happened I quickly put him in my room n took another cat out, he came running after us n I manage to close the rm door. I am really frightened if he bites me again. He needs a loving home that has no other cats to be threatened. He is a darling to kittens n even allows the kitten to suck milk but will really put up a fight with any male cats. I really can't handle him any longer as I do bring in rescued cats to my place. I hope that he finds a good loving home with no other adult cats. By.. n by if I hv no other options I will put him out as strays (he will injure other stray cats then) or put him to sleep (thats my vry last resort which I am not too keen). Pls gv suggestions or advise as what I shld do. The best is hv him adopted to a loving home without other cats around.

Very affectionate chap. He doesn't complain alot, he just wants love, he doesn't care if you're going to hurt him. :(! Really! Great companion. He purrs when I'm near, or just by hanging out with me. Sesame is sometimes too brave, he likes to hang out with cats who aren't very easy with him around, wants to make friends he said, says he doesn't want to make enemies haha. Sesame's the runt, meaning he is smaller than average cats. Has a best buddy in the whole world, Peanuts. Peanuts: Follows wherever Sesame goes. Both Sesame & Peanuts are usually seen running around the field like in cartoons. Peanuts is very timid, craves to be around you, but just scared. I believe he had some bad past with humans. ONLY! when you close your eyes or pretend you're not looking at him, he'll come close, haha! Alot of times Peanuts squint his eyes during day time when there's sun, like as if he just came out from the cave, we just think he's hinting us for a pair of sunnies. Very CUTE meows, playful, he's the one who initiates all the games with Sesame. :) Just like Sesame, they like to hang out with bigger cats whether the other cats like it or not, says they want to make friends, not war. I'm looking for committed, serious, adopters. Adopters who will make sure they will be taken care of, ensure they will not run away to become stray again. They are both preferred to be given to the same adopter. Rescued by me, and I will be willing to get them vet-checked, neutered, and microchipped. Neighbors are feeding poison to the cats, there has been alot of dead cats around.... I suspect they did put some in the place where i feed the cats, but i was lucky to have seen it before the cats.. My only issue is that, Peanuts is very timid and might take time to get used to the future adopter, so they're best to be kept indoors all the time to avoid them being stray again. Both of them must go together to the same adopter. Kitties and I will appreciate your help so much. Thanks for dropping by. :)!",6da1ee245,25,4

He's a very friendly and happy boy who loves being petted and hugged, and gets along easily with people and other pets. He's also toilet trained to do his business indoors (on a pan) although he will prefer to do his business on grass if he can. Once he trusts you, if you go out for walks, he will follow you around without a need a for lease and will not disturb other passerbys (unless they disturb him, which is a normal reaction for dogs). He knows his name and usually comes when you call, even stands without running when showered. Romeo would make a wonderful companion for families with children or anyone who does not want an overly active dog. He's spayed and had his first vaccination. He has also proven himself to have a strong will to live and enjoy life because early in January , he was found (by me) lying on the street, completely paralysed and injured quite badly. He had gotten into a bad dog fight, suspected to be over a female in heat (hence the name, Romeo!). At the time, Romeo could not move his whole body and only could slightly move his head and needed help even to eat. During that time, he proved his intelligence by toilet training himself to go to the right pee/poo spot in my house just by observing my other dogs! Even when he couldn't stand properly, he would crawl over to the pee pan and do his business. After a few months of physiotherapy and love, thankfully now he can walk and run very well, although not perfectly and he also cannot jump (e.g. over drains, etc). Even with his limitations, he loves every chance he gets to go out and walk around, while at home, he will come to you for love and attention, giving you a silly happy derp face that you can't help but fall in love with! :) By the way, just because he cannot move completely normally does not mean he will not defend you and your house, as he will bark at potential danger, just like any loyal dog would!

Unfortunately, because of this her history is unknown. The vet is unsure of her exact age but puts her between 6-7 years old. When we took Sophie home she was underweight and her eyes were a leaky mess. She had obviously not been loved or cared for in quite some time. She's now healthy and looking for a true furever home. Sophie's sweet & affectionate towards people and other dogs but would be happiest to be the only female dog in the house.

Be warned that she is a licker :) 2) She protectively guards the house, barking when people are near. So she makes a great guard dog/doorbell. 3) She does NOT bark all the time and annoy the neighbours 4) She is intelligent, e.g. she knew how to use my dog potty mat without any training, and will obey if you tell her to sit instead of jumping on you when you're eating. 5) She's not hyperactive but active enough that you can jog with her if you want a jogging companion. 6) Fully vaccinated, dewormed and spayed with no known health problems. However she was previously abandoned and possibly abused by her previous owner, resulting in some occasional aggression due to insecurity and fear. While she is friendly with most people and male dogs, she is occasionally (not always) aggressive when around other FEMALE DOGS, and in SMALL CONFINED SPACES or TIED UP for too long BY HERSELF. Meaning under these conditions, she might growl, snarl and in the case of female dogs, potentially fight with the other dog, but not all the time as she is usually playful with other females once she is used to them. She does NOT have this problem with male dogs and she also does NOT bite people, including children, unless you intentionally agitate her (in which case, you shouldn't be adopting a dog). So if you're an experienced dog owner with an open heart and willing to give an occasionally temperamental dog a loving home, please read on. Interested adopters should: - Be experienced in keeping dogs, as well as able to keep calm and handle somewhat aggressive dogs. Angel can easily be approached by a person she trusts and touched to calm her down as I do this often. - Preferably already have a mature and friendly MALE dog to keep her company, especially if you are frequently away. No female dog owners, for the reasons stated above. I have a male dog whom Angel gets along with perfectly fine. - Preferably have garden/porch for her to run in when you are out. Although she is used to living in a house, she will get agitated if you leave her in the house alone. She is fine if left by herself in a garden whole day or if someone or another dog is with her in the house. I'm giving Angel up not because I cannot stand her behaviour, but because I wish to do more dog rescue work which involves me temporarily keeping unfamiliar dogs, including nursing mothers, at my house, and I do not want her attacking the female dogs. Also because I may plan to move overseas in a few years and will take all my dogs, but Angel will be extremely stressed if in a plane and quarantine for a long period. Thanks for reading, and if interested to give Angel a wonderful forever home, please call Carol at. Located in Subang Jaya.",a906ff5f5,6,4

Placing a dog in different homes especially with his condition is already stressful enough for him. Please sit down and think before agreeing to give this poor boy a new home. Thank you. ********************************** I adopted Samba back in and was informed that he had been abused during the four years that he was being taken cared of. He was caged most of the time and according to the doctor he was also beaten. Samba is an extremely gentle and loyal dog, and will follow you everywhere you go. He does not like being left alone, and is ONLY kept indoors. He is extremely afraid of loud noises especially when it is raining or when there are fireworks. Samba is also potty trained, and needs to go for his walks as frequent as possible. Unless you have a backyard in which he is able to go to the toilet then he needs his daily walks at least once a day. It would be great if I can find him a good home, someone who has A LOT, A LOT of patience. Kindly contact me through here if interested.",461b33f39,1,4

I have rescued him twice & this is the third. I did try to talk to his owner, apparently she won't take my advice seriously. Jack Jack feds on human ta pau food. Three times a week. That's right, ONLY 3x a week. He often comes to me for food, water & doggie snack. Of course I will give it to him without his owner knowing. Bear in mind, not every owner likes their dog to be fed by ""strangers"". Anything could happen to their dog & blame will be on the ""strangers"". Jack Jack will be left outside at night after everyone went back. He couldn't find a good spot if it rains at night. Few days, I haven't seen Jack Jack. I went looking for him in his cage. He was too weak to walk & wag his tail. Then I found out there's a hole in his back with maggots! Took me 3 days to gain his trust in order for me to ""trap"" him! Made it! He has recovered from his wound (picture shown) Ok, somehow he is making himself comfortable staying in my regular vet! Food, water, love, care. Away from scoring sunshine & rain. What he needs now is a good home. I can't put him back to where he once belonged. This is why: His owner apparently ask me ""have you seen [that] dog?"" To that I replied her, ""He's dead."" And she goes, ""oh.. ok."" She didn't even bother to ask what has happened, why... I'm not seeking a thank you from her but this makes me feeling more sad & pity for Jack Jack. Oh yes, he responds to this name given by me. And yes, he has no name with his previous owner. So, there you have it, I can't bring Jack Jack ""back to life"".

He has two pairs of sharp light blue eyes and full white body fur. Reason of giving up my boy is I'm flying to overseas to work. I need someone who is willing to commit to take care of him and give him lots and lots of love. Requirements : - The new owner house must be landed property so that Luffy can run around to release his energy. - He needs to be indoor due to Malaysia weather is hot and he is a Siberian Husky which needs to be at a cooling area. - New owner must tell me if he/she have any experience of handling large breed dog. - Must have family acceptance. - Please do not adopt if you are looking for PEDIGREE as I am giving away him for a forever loving home. * Serious Adopters ONLY * If you are interested you can always WhatsApp me and introduced yourself. Thank you,1f82b8bf0,3,2

Neglecting him would have meant leave him to a slow and painful death. I looked after the cat, and his recovery's been great, but still under antibiotic as the biggest holes hasn't sealed completely, hopefully he'll be healed by the end of this week. I am a traveler, and I must leave Malaysia as my visa expires. We've come all the way to KK to find a real home for him, as I am not allowed to cross into other country with the cat. Michi is male, small size, half-short tailed, about 3 years old, and healthy (no skin deseases). He is quiet, sweet, adorable, not picky with his food, and most importantly LOW MAINTAINANCE. It's hard for me to leave him, as he's the most caring thing I have seen in cats. We had great adventures: we hitch-hiked for two days from somewhere near Tawau, to get here. So you can add ""well traveled"" to his qualities. I must leave KK by Sat 11th Aug. Still after this date, please contact me, as I may not have found a place for him. Do you think you can give him a second chance? You can also help by sending this page to your friends Have a look at more pictures of Michi Terima Kasih!",1e011d469,5,1

The female is smaller in size and is full cream in color whereas the male is slightly bigger in size and has light brown patches/marking all over the body. Both are very attached to each other so if preferably i'd like them to be adopter together, but if you however can only manage one, it'll be good enough as long as you can provide a loving home and care. I'd like them to be spayed at 6 months old too to prevent future pregnancies and also because spaying them will eliminate the risk of uterus and testicular cancer in the future and in turn they will be healthier and have less health complications.

He sometimes bounces around in the garden as he does not like wet grass. He is very friendly, obedient, and a calm dog; he is not noisy at all. He gets along with other dogs and cats and perfect for family with children. He especially loves younger children like toddlers. He loves going for walks and hiking as well.

In october she was found with an injured leg, so we took her to the veterinary. Her leg is healed very well, she now just has to build up leg muscles again, because she did not use this leg for about 2 weeks - best way to train is to play ;) She is well socialized: - loves humans: loves to be petted, likes to give kisses nose to nose, is cuddling and talking - very patient (had to take a lot of medicines and still loves me ;) - not afraid of noises - using litter box perfectly We can not keep her, so we needed to put her back in the compound, when the leg had healed. Update 6th Nov : Bobo has developed some skin problems, it turned out to be a fungus called ""ringworm"". She is treated with medicine against it. Bobo received her first vacination yesterday. She is back in the compound, where the guards are caring for the cats, they are providing food and fresh water. There is also another cat in that age, certainly Bobos sibling. And there is a highly pregnant cat around too... Will check her status every now and then... Update .16 Bobo definitly lost weight - she has grown so nice under our care :( Maybe loss of appetite because of medicine or she does not get enough food...she is the smallest cat around! Still hoping to be adopted... Update 17th November: The skinproblems are gone XD, hair is growing back very fast! She needs to take pills for 6 more days and get powdered 2 more weeks to really get rid of the fungus. Great recovery, tough girl! She is always around the guardhouse, when I visit. As well as her sister, a beauty in white and orange (see photo below and further profile). She is always coming to me too :). They are very different in character, but I think they are a good couple! Can be adopted together ;) Both are so friendly, bonded to humans and love to be petted! But definivly too skinny... I hope to find a serious adopter who will give her a nice home, love and a healthy life with good cat food, prevention of ticks, fleas and worms, medical attention if needed in future and after all a friend to play with! She should be further vaccinated and neutered. Please whatsApp me, if any questions.",3a64a5704,12,3

Plus, look at that cute little face! While we are ideally looking for someone who will adopt them as a trio, we will also consider anyone who wants to adopt them in pairs or individually. But fair warning, the kittens are very skittish and timid - we only found them when they were 1 1/2 months old and they aren't quite used to humans yet. They require alot of time and patience to let them warm up to you so if you don't have that then they might not be suitable for you. But trust us, with time and patience and alot of love, you will see how incredibly sweet and lovable they all are. Also, a household with small children is not advisable as skittish/nervous kittens don't work well with little tykes.

I've only had one loving owner but since she's moved, the management of her new condo does not allow the keeping of pets. So I am hoping to find a new kind owner who is willing to adopt me. My owner has already vaccinated and de-wormed me. I've always been kept indoors so I am very healthy without any disease or ticks. I also know basic tricks like sit, stay, come, down, roll, paw (shake hand) and fetch. I hope to find a new family that will love me and that I can love back. If possible a family that will keep me indoors and not caged. If this sounds like you and you are located in KL area, please do contact my owner. I promise that I will try to be a good and loyal doggie. Please adopt me. Love Always, Oreo P/S: My current owner also has a doggie cage, toys, chew snacks, and dog food which she is willing to give away FOC to my rescuer. She will also send me for full grooming before handing me over. =========================================== Additional info about Oreo - Oreo is 90% toilet trained. He goes outside at the laundry area where I put newspapers. But sometimes he leaves me little ‚Äúpresents‚Äù in the house. - I don‚Äôt cage Oreo at all so he‚Äôs not used to be locked up in a cage. - Oreo stays home most of the time but I will bring him out at least once every two weeks. He loves being in the car and is very well behaved. Never did ""business"" in the car before or get car sick. - If Oreo knows that there's someone in the house he generally doesn't bark at all, but he will bark a bit if he's left alone in house. - Oreo is more ""sticky"" compared to my previous dogs. He will follow you around the house no matter what you are doing. So he's not the type that will only come to you if you have food. - Currently I feed Oreo dried dog food (Blackwood) mixed with either canned dog food or some rice + leftovers. - Oreo's fur does get much longer (can probably touch the floor) than in the photos. I kept it short on purpose as it is easier to maintain. - Oreo sleeps alone outside in the living room area, he's not allowed in the bedroom.",8f15fc3d8,11,1

He was soaking wet, shivering, full of worms and with a snapped back leg (it stuck out at right angles to his body). It looks to me like somebody stamped on him, whether accidentally or on purpose I don't know. He was too cute to leave sitting there. I took him to the office, and we all nurtured him back to health. For a while we thought his leg might need to be amputated, but he quickly sorted himself out, with a little help from the vet and a lot of love from everybody in the office. Now he's a healthy happy kitten, with insane amounts of energy. He's still a little bit wonky when he runs and pounces, but basically he's % tip top. He's very affectionate, loves people, hates being alone. He's a real lap cat who also loves nothing more than riding round on my shoulders, falling asleep on people and stopping us from doing work. Anything that moves is chased, he'll be a great mouse/cockroach killer. He's fun to play with. He also likes being around other cats. He can be a bit naughty, but is cute enough to get away with it, and he's only young. He's completely house trained, he uses the litter tray (he's most particular about this, was the easiest cat to train I ever had). Sadly he lives in a place of work, where we can't give him enough attention because we're all busy (basically watching him play is a massive time waster for all of us, a great excuse not to work, but). Also, since the office is empty at night he gets lonely and howls. He really needs a loving home, where he can sleep indoors where people are. I wish I could keep him, but it's not fair to Wonky. We're going to get him neutered and vaccinated this week. Please give a call if you want a loving furball in your life. Only nice people who can give him a loving home need apply.

He ran for his life when we approached him, but then when he realised that we were just trying to help he came up to us albeit cautiously. After bribing him with a can of Cesar dog food, he decided that we were his best buddies, jumped into the car quite happily. Please call us at or if this is your dog. If he isn't please share this with all your friends so that we can reunite him with his family. We have already taken him to the vet for a check up.

When I got to her, she was shy but then warmed up quickly to friendly petting. From petting, she was partially covered in mange, her ears & face crusty and loosing fur. We took her in and gave her the medical attention needed to cure her of that nasty skin problem (also to avoid having all the other stray cats being infected as well). We suspect that she was dumped out by someone when her mange infection got worst. Few weeks later, after the last of the mange, Chloe's fur grew back and she is now a beautiful kitten growing normally. While our other rescue dog was still around, Chloe would sneak out to play with the dog too. Chloe's got a distinctive gray pattern on her left eye, and cream pattern on her right. A gray comet-like pattern on her white-cream head, and a beautiful fluffy tri-coloured tail of mostly gray tones. She has pale blue eyes, her fur is medium-long 80% white, paws pink with patches of dark gray/black. Chloe is used to being around people, loves to play on her own or with us and will not hesitate to ""tell"" you when she is hungry or in need of affectionate pets. If her usual toys won't keep her busy, she is also a curious kitten, who would love to follow us around just to see what we are up to. When we are away for a while, we'd come home to find her sitting by the gate, waiting for us. Eversince the viral cat flu, we have kept Chloe indoors all the way, to which she's got no problems. Chloe is fully vaccinated, dewormed, checked for fleas (clean!) and has recently been spayed. We would like to find Chloe to find a good home and family who will love to have this curious kitty & take care of her throughout. We have no doubt that Chloe will be a great little vocal companion to your life if you're looking for a furry friend to call your own. The reason for the adoption fees : 1. Chloe has been trained to use the litter box. 2. She recognises her name and will come to you when called. In order for her to listen to you, you must first gain her trust. 3. Chloe is fed on a mixed diet of premium kiblets and also specially prepared clean, real food (fish meat, chicken meat..etc) in order to allow her to absorb the best of nutrients and grow as a healthy cat. 4. Her lovely long fur is kept as clean as possible. 5. She is also used to car rides and being around people. 6. Chloe understands that she has her sleeping routine and play times.

However, he can still stay alive on 29-Oct! I saw he was really suffering! So I decided to sent him to a vet. He stayed at the clinic for 5 days and cost me RM. Now he is very healthy and active.

My family and I have been nurturing her back to good health and training her with basic command. Unfortunately we are unable to foster her for an extended duration of time because of our working culture. She has the potential to be a worthy dog, as such I am looking for the best option for her. This shall be a process for adoption, as a friendly reminder, this is NOT a process of buying-selling. Whereby, a second visit shall be considered as conclusive that both of the adopter‚Äôs and c‚Äômie criteria fits each other. By the end of this week .. the decision for the adoption will be made. I‚Äôm pleased to answer further questions regarding her characteristics and behaviour. As a general overview, she is an energetic, adventurous and fast-learning puppy. At time she is stubborn, vocal (She now has better control of excitement, she is not aggressive) and pleads with you thru the trick of the trade for being a puppy. She behaves well when you are grooming her, if she behaves otherwise, all she needs is time to relax beforehand. She requires a compound and daily walks. Preferably she is adopted by a family with basic knowledge of caring for a dog, a family with children and a family that is inclined for outdoor activities. She would require training to be an obedient dog as she possesses the traits of a dominant dog. Above all else, she reacts best with positive reinforcement. She is more likely to grow bigger but not taller. Her best features is her paws, it is strong and sturdy. Adoption fees RM includes Hills prescription diet I/D (More or less sufficient for July), Ear Drops, Ears Cleaning Fluid, Dog Bowl, Collar (She was found with this collar, would require a bigger collar when she grows bigger) and leash and Dog Bowl. If the adopter does not have a dog cage, I‚Äôm willing to provide mine for RM, as it is intended to be donated to the ASPCA. ********** End of Update ********** A puppy with RED collar was found at Padang Merbok. She was wandering about until my group of friends decided to play with her. During the drive to SPCA, it is apparent that she has experience being in the car. SPCA has placed her under the waiting list for adoption. A trip to the vet has confirmed that she has has negative result in both distemper and parvo cvirus. However, she does have an extended stomach as she has not been eating well. Within 2 weeks of regular feeding, it would allow her to return to good health. A treatable physical ailment is that she does have ear mites. Her ears are now cleaned daily coupled with the administration of ear drops. Now that she feels at comfort, it is apparent that she is an intelligent dog that would requires obedience and discipline. She is potentially a good guard dog, respective to the general traits of a German Shepard Dog. She DOES know that there are certain things that would get her into trouble. She will proceed with guilty eyes and plead vocally with you. She chooses to relief herself outdoors, groom herself post-walk. As of yet, there are no listing found for her. Her owner is still being sought after. Due to the extensive working hours during the weekday and marathon training during the weekend, I am unable to foster her for an extended period of time. She would be well suited for an active lifestyle.",6469a2a4a,5,2

He is a little shy, but he LOVES being picked up and petted. He ALWAYS purrs when I pick him up and he will sit on your lap indefinitely! He just loves being around people and being held.

She wasn't sure when the kittens were placed there, but she knew the poor kittens had at least traveled one journey in there, probably traumatized beyond belief. Since the lady did not know how long the kittens were there, she could not know where they came from and where their mother is, and this is when my aunt called me for help. I named them Nobu (the white one) and Yoshi (the orange one) after Japanese warlords Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Strong names for two strong boys. Nobu had an eye infection at the time of rescue, but had cleared up now with eye ointment. Both kittens had also been dewormed at the same time. They are currently about 1.5 months old to be accurate. I had successfully weaned them off milk, and they can eat kibbles on their own now. (RC baby kitten) Though they do still enjoy milk on the occasion. They are litter trained, though can still get messy at times kicking litter all over. Yoshi the orange tabby is the older brother, the bigger of the two. He has the CUTEST round eyes and can be quite manja. He is more mild mannered compared to Nobu, but is a fast learner. He purrs loudly. Nobu is the younger one but he is also the adventurous one. He is extremely curious and likes to explore wherever he can get to via whatever method he can. (jump, climb etc) However, he can be a bit messy, spilling kibbles all over, getting milk beards, stepping into the water bowl etc. He has a super cute 'mew' though! Both kittens are extremely playful, Yoshi especially LOVES to play with feathers. They can also be potential lap cats. I used to bottle feed milk to them on my lap sitting on a small stool, even though I don't now since they broke their milk bottle, sometimes they still like to climb onto my lap and I'll pet them. ******SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY****** - It would be most preferable if they can be adopted together, I don't want to split the two brothers since they are quite attached to each other. - They must be spayed at the age of 6-8 months. - The brothers must be kept INDOORS since they do not grow up on the streets and are not street smart.

The rescuer had seeked our services in bringing Rex personally to the clinic for treatment and to be boarded. He has been boarded in the clinic since March and is looking for a loving home. Efforts are being made to make this happen for Rex. Rex needs someone who will patiently want to know him for who he is. Rex loves to play fetch and he loves to gnaw on his chew bone. He loves them dental treats too :) A perfect guard dog because this boy is alert at all times, forget tip toeing away because he notices everything! Once he builds his trust in you, you could certainly find a loyal friend in him. His favourite past time is to sit and watch the world go by with you. Honesty is the best policy and these are my thoughts - Boarding is part of the services provided but it isn't the main function. If I'm lucky during my working hours, I could spend up to an hour plus with him but those days are harder to come by. Otherwise its after my working hours / when I'm off / working half day. His walks are only limited to the clinic's back lane and his view of the world is decreasing as months pass by in my opinion. Picture this, put ourselves in his shoes, who likes the same old mundane view and then its back to being caged the rest of the time and the cycle repeats? I get it that the rescuer is financing his stay but one must be realistic. I just don't think its healthy for Rex or any animal per say to be boarded for a long time, and in Rex's case, is he still going to be boarded until the end of the year? Next year? Look into his eyes..tell me you don't see what I see? There is a story there..All he needs is someone who is willing to decode it. His eyes do look sad to me too, its like as though he is crying out and wondering is this what his life is going to be like? Rescuing an animal is one thing but you also have to think about the animal's wellbeing too since he has been here since March! Its not about the money, its about his happiness. Other animals they come and go and Rex? He is just here. Its heartbreaking to see his life at a standstill like this. Just awaiting for someone to adopt him and the wait has extended for months and months. I do feel it a lot since I am the one who has the most contact with him. If I hadn't vigorously started getting the word out about Rex, no one would have really heard about him. The rescuer has never once visited him, nor was there any posters or flyers made on her part to be distributed. The last time she had asked about Rex was ages ago. If human beings could get depression, animals could too. Please introduce yourself by calling / e-mailing / dropping by the clinic if you want to give Rex a chance to be himself again..

I had an accident several months ago , my right front leg was badly injured, I had to drag my leg when I walked. Later, it became infectious. The pain was unbearable. Everywhere I went, people despised me. Then I found a place at a parking lot in a big condo where I could hide and rest. A lady who lives there noticed me while on her way to work. She was kind to me. As days passed, I began to trust her. One day I threw myself in front of her car and blocked it. I did not move till she came down and saw my condition. She called for her sons and one of her friends for help but i only trusted her, she put a leash on me and sent me to a nearby clinic. By then my leg was badly damaged , the vet had to amputate my front leg. After one week, i was discharged from the clinic but the lady dose not have any place to keep me so she asked somebody for help. My picture was posted up in facebook and lots of good-hearted people called and offered to foster me till I recover. Now I'm fully recovered and in need of a forever loving home. I am a very sweet girl , cheerful and playful dog. Please give me a chance to have a good life. Thank you.",16ffedcf8,7,3

Then, her family left Malaysia‚Ä¶ and dropped her in our condo garage. She has been surviving there for approximately 2 years, having 4 litters. Thanks to a lot of patience, we managed to get closer, feeding her and giving her some cuddles. Last week, I finally managed to catch her to get her neutered and vaccinated. She must be around 3 or 4 years old. She is a tokinese mix breed. She has beautiful green eyes, and a black-brown fur. She is litter trained. She would need a family that has experience with cats and a lot of patience. She had to learn to survive the hard way and she is now quite suspicious of humans. But, she has shown a lot of love to us which brought the decision to try to find a family for her, to avoid releasing her. We are going to keep her one more week to give her the time to heal properly. If we found no takers by Sunday, she will be released. We are putting a lot of time and money to save the cats around our condo. To that extend, we are only considering the family who are doing no caging. Having been in the streets, she will not bear to be caged, even for the night. Moreover, we want a family that will keep her indoors at the beginning, the time that she is learning back to be a domestic cat. She will need your love and your patience in order to feel secure again. If you want to give her a new start in life, please contact me before Sunday the 22nd (April).",39c654eaa,5,3

He had long fur before, but his fur hasn't grown any longer since; so I need to reclassify him as domestic medium hair now, not domestic long hair. He had marbled speckled green eyes, but they have changed to a green/yellow color, and are less specked. Parsley loves playing with other cats; he likes to play on his own as well. He'll find a comfortable place to sleep when he's tired. Parsley has a good appetite and doesn't meow much--only when he's hungry. I've also de-wormed him today. I fostered Parsley from SPCA. He has a cotton soft coat, speckled eyes, and a short tail. He is the boss when eating; he hits the bowl with his paw and stares at other cats who're sharing food with him. All the cats, including my own, stop when he does that (he doesn't bite or scratch though). What is funny is that he always gets beaten up by other cats when playing. He learns fast: When he meows too much and I shush him he goes quite, then he looks like he's meowing, but with very little sound. That's sweet. Parsley is playful. I'm currently feeding Orijen to Pasley; I feed it to all my cats these days. I used to feed my own cats Royal Canin Hair & Skin, but after I realised it wasn't the best quality food I changed to Origen straight away. I was feeding my rescued cats Acana, but switched to Origen when I found that Acana was often out of stock. I also give cats mineral water/filtered water as I don't like to give them tap water; it's got too many chemicals like chlorine etc. The adopter has to agree to bring Parsley back to me to be neutered around mid January next year. I will pay the neutering fee. Neutering/spaying cats can reduce the number of strays. Many cats get killed everyday by accidents, humans, or dogs. Unneutered males can get many females pregnant during the mating season, so please support neutering/spaying to save lives All the adoption fees will go to trapping and neutering/spaying other strays. The cats I catch will either be returned to nature (TNR), or their photos will be put on PetFinder to be re-homed. A cat's average life is years, but some live up to 20 years if they are well looked after. It is a commitment if you want to have a pet cat. Please DO NOT dump them if they are not cute anymore; they have feelings as well, just like we do. Please give me a ring or sms if you are interested. Thank you. Here is a bit of information about cat food: Cats can't tolerate corn and wheat; they cause cats a lot of health problems. The common brands of cat food--such as Friskies, Smartheart, and Whiskers--contain a lot of these ingredients and are awfully bad for cats. Corn and wheat are just used because they are cheap, but they have no benefit for cats. Well known premium brands, like Royal Canin and Science Plan, also contain corn/maize. I'm unhappy with these companies because their products are pricey, but the quality isn't excellent to match! There are a few other brands that are better quality and don't contain corn and wheat, but at a similar price to Royal Canin and Science Plan: Orijen, Acana, Natural Balance, Evo and Feline Caviar(Holistic) all have 0% corn and wheat and are much better quality.",8c1658988,30,2

I was born in the bushes somewhere in Sri Petaling on the 9th September . I was sent to PAWS Mission shelter in early November and was fostered shortly after that by Richard. When Richard took me home, I was quite sick and was quickly taken to the Vet clinic where I was diagnosed with tick fever and put on blood transfusion immediately. I had to stay overnight at the clinic, which terrified me. I remember the vet telling Richard that I was whining a fair bit in my cage. After a few more vet visits and with lots of medication (yuckkhh!!) and supplements, I feel much, much better now. That was 2 months ago. I now have a very healthy appetite and weigh about 6.5 kg. Richard has been feeding me kibbles (with cod liver oil & supplement topping), canned food and rice cooked with liver and chicken(yummy!!). I also get those occasional treats when I'm able to follow some simple instructions like sit and shake hands (Shhh - don‚Äôt tell anyone but I am only doing this so that I can get the goodies ). I'm also very energetic now and enjoy running around in the yard and playing fetch the ball/bone/tree branch with Richard. I was vaccinated on 20th December after given a clean bill of health by the vet. As Richard is unable to look after me permanently :(, I am looking to be part of a loving new family :). I am very affectionate, intelligent and loyal ‚Äì I won‚Äôt try to leave home. Like most puppies though, I occasionally love shoes & slippers, digging dirt to bury my goodies and playfully nip Richard‚Äôs hand (he knows I‚Äôm just playing with him). I am still maturing and like human kids need to be shown where my boundaries are. If you like my story and would like to adopt me as part of your family, please call Mrs. Lai at or Richard at .

As i was away yesterday, i told my brother to keep a lookout for the female cat and it seems she hasnt returned since last night. They have been crying for quite a while and I think they're just hungry. In the mean time, we're taking care of these kittens, feeding it with milk replacement.

As the owner is working and fearing Angel may hurt herself, he is currently living in a cage 24 hours a day. The owner would like Angel to have a normal life running and playing around just like other dogs. We are now looking for a loving home for little Angel. It's our hope to find a owner who accept him with this disabilities and love him unconditionally so he can live life to the fullest. Our recommendation to potential adopters : a) Ask yourself the following questions : - Am I ready to be the owner of a blind dog. - Did I have the commitment needed? - Did I have the knowledge? - Did I have the right conditions in my home? - Most importantly, did I have the love in my heart to raise this dog? b) Allocate time so both yourself and Angel can understand each other. c) Provide time for training so Angel can recognise sounds. If you believe you can raise Angel and in return inspired others to care/raise blind puppies, please contact me for further details. ‚ÄúBlind Dogs See With Their Heart and Are Worth Loving‚Äù.",d596234fc,4,3

There were only 2 remaining when I tried to get them adopted through Petfinder but failed for months as they were highly afraid of humans and fled into an opening whenever I tried to get closer, probably due to the constant abuse, threats and beatings from the restaurant workers. I could always hear them crying out in pain/fear from my home. Sadly I believe her brother was bludgeoned to death. There was nothing I could do until one day during a heavy downpour which flooded her place of refuge, I found her at my doorstep. We have been fostering her and can finally post her up for adoption after 2 weeks of getting her to trust and adapt to humans. She is still cautious and slightly fearful but we managed to give her a bath and continue building her confidence. Hope to find her a good home soon so she can be loved and cared for. She's smart and cheerful too and I'm sure you will enjoy having her as part of your family.

She found me behind her house surrounded by dogs!! She quickly picked me up and brought me inside her house. Sadly auntie Rebecca is busy fostering 5 pups and their mum so she called my new foster mummy Lynette for help. When i arrived at mummy Lyn's house she was amazed by how chubby and healthy i looked!! She says i'm so cute that i make her eyes hurt!! I'm not weaned yet so mummy Lyn still has to feed me kitty milk. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT.

I will ask a lot of questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Theo vaccinated before being able to take Theo home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I will make a home visit. - Adopter may have to provide me with occasional updates. Interested parties can call, sms, or email me.

After falling very ill with tick fever and being attacked and mauled by the strays in the area, Stan and his wife decided she had to get of the streets. I am fostering Lassie and she has been with me for about 2 months. She loves other dogs and will have no trouble going to a family with other dogs. She will chase nervous cats but does not hurt them. Confident cats who stand their ground get their due respect. She is beautiful; I think a cross between Border Collie and Labrador. She learns fast and is eager to please. She is calm indoors but can walk and run for hours if you're the active type. She may knock small children over with her enthusiasm but there isn't an ounce of malice in her and this will subside with age. Moreover she prefers to snuggle up and nap with her people.

Our neighbours and friends chipped in for his treatment, and after a few months in the vet he's now up and about, and staying with us for the time being, until we find him a loving home. My housemates and I love him a lot, but unfortunately we won't be able to keep him as the three of us are not always home, and we aren't sure how long we'll be staying in this house. Chance is still young, the vet said at most 1.5 years. He is full of energy, but reasonably well behaved. A common friend of ours who is a dog-owner showed my housemates and I how to care for him. We take him for walks and/or runs daily - which is great because we get to exercise too! He's great company - generally listens and follows us when we walk, and does not bark at other dogs in houses we pass by. He's tries to make friends with cats and other dogs we meet on walks, but he's not always very lucky. Chance is a wonderful dog. As long as his energy is channeled regularly into positive activity, he will be very well behaved. He has misbehaved before, he chewed up my housemate's slippers and my bicycle pedals - but that's only because we forgot to take him out that day and he was bored out of his wits staying home alone. We haven't taught him any tricks, but he knows that whenever he sits down / calms down, good things may happen (i.e. go for walks, runs, gets more petting etc) - we try our best to encourage good behavior with treats or toys (tennis ball, stick, chewed up slipper etc), and we try our best to curb bad behavior either by ignoring it or staying away, or a pat on the bum with rolled up newspaper. We have about a quarter of a 20kg bag of dog food, treats, a leash, a chain, water and food bowl to give away as well. We just want Chance to find a loving home where he can be happy.",ed97f6919,3,4

We spotted one huge open wound that a fly just went there to settle itself and didnt come out.. It was a late evening, on a saturday, most vet around our area already closed, so we took her to MediVet Hospital in Jalan Tun Razak. Doctor found about 4 maggot wounds on her, one near her left ear, 3 near the tail area. She had to be hospitalized for 4 days, did blood work as well as viral test, which she was negative for. She was anemic and her heart was weakened due to the prolonged infection. She even had to be force-fed with the IV on. Now she is so much more energetic with good appetite! Her suturing was done as well, medication is on for 7 days prior to her discharge on the 19th. Frigga is a very manja girl, who is quite obedient for a stray..she even waited for you to walk first when you walk her. She gets a little anxious when you leave her on her own, but as long as she can roam around the house she does not whine so much. But all in all, she is really a lovable sweet girl..I cant keep her because my father doesnt tolerate dogs. It was fortunate enough after much talk from my mom he agreed to let her stay for 10 days. PLEASE, anyone who would want a manja/loving dog who is playful and sweet, give her a new permanent home. She is friendly with people and even my cats.. :)",a9391d398,4,4
